## electronics & crafting soft sensors

![Day Four Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.) 

Hacking machines and making open source machines for knitting, electronics,
These things were particularly interesting to me:

I've been so obsessed with dyeing that I haven't done anything else for a while, but stay tuned...


## Soft Sensors

We've been working on soft sensors at Fab Lab Wgtn for a while now. In particular, a workshop that Hannah and Craig developed together for a conference. Craig then ran it at Fab 12, in Shenzhen (spending quite a bit of time at Huaqiangbei, the electronics market, acquiring the materials for it). Since then we've been tweaking it; changing the instruction booklets, making new samples, rethinking the interaction with the testing board he designed for it and created the ... resist-O-meter.

For using when you've made your soft sensor - you see a pompom attached above, with a mix of conductive yarn & wool - you attach the alligator clips to a couple of pieces of the conductive yarn (the grey/silver). If you've made it correctly, squeezing the pompom will make more lights on the resist-O-meter light up, showing a change in resistance.

We ran the newest version of the workshop a couple of weeks before the Fab13 conference, and here are some photos from that session.

Prior to running this session, I decided to apply the soft sensors in a fun way. I think the first time I saw someone wearing a crocheted beard was at Fab 10 in Barcelona. Correct me if I'm wrong, Anastasia... Anyway, apparently, it's appealing to all ages & genders.

Apart from being very warming in winter, they give a certain gravitas to any occasion. Adding soft sensors to a beard was a natural extension. Here are some photos of what I did.

You will see some little LEDs which have resistors included, which I've connected in parallel using conductive thread. These are connected to the ripstop and to the battery (which has its own little crocheted bag). The 'switch' is a stroke sensor, which is made of loops of conductive thread, which, when you stroke them, complete the circuit to light the LEDS.
