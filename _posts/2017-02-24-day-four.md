## electronics & crafting soft sensors

![Day Four Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.) 

Hacking machines and making open source machines for knitting, electronics,
These things were particularly interesting to me:

[Var & Mar - including circular knitic](http://www.var-mar.info/)

[Nintendo Knitting Machine](http://kotaku.com/5939210/this-long-lost-nintendo-knitting-machine-would-have-let-you-make-sweaters-with-your-nes)

I've been so obsessed with dyeing that I haven't done anything else for a while, but stay tuned...


## Soft Sensors

We've been working on soft sensors at Fab Lab Wgtn for a while now. In particular, a workshop that Hannah and Craig developed together for a conference. Craig then ran it at Fab 12, in Shenzhen (spending quite a bit of time at Huaqiangbei, the electronics market, acquiring the materials for it). Since then we've been tweaking it; changing the instruction booklets, making new samples, rethinking the interaction with the test board he designed for it and created the ... resist-O-meter.
