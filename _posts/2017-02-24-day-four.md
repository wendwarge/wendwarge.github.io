## electronics & crafting soft sensors

![Day Four Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.) 

Hacking machines and making open source machines for knitting, electronics,
These things were particularly interesting to me:

I've been so obsessed with dyeing that I haven't done anything else for a while, but stay tuned...


## Soft Sensors

We've been working on soft sensors at Fab Lab Wgtn for a while now. In particular, a workshop that Hannah and Craig developed together for a conference. Craig then ran it at Fab 12, in Shenzhen (spending quite a bit of time at Huaqiangbei, the electronics market, acquiring the materials for it). Since then we've been tweaking it; changing the instruction booklets, making new samples, rethinking the interaction with the testing board he designed for it and created the ... resist-O-meter.

For using when you've made your soft sensor - you see a pompom attached above, with a mix of conductive yarn & wool - you attach the alligator clips to a couple of pieces of the conductive yarn (the grey/silver). If you've made it correctly, squeezing the pompom will make more lights on the resist-O-meter light up, showing a change in resistance.

We ran the newest version of the workshop a couple of weeks before the Fab13 conference, and here are some photos from that session.
