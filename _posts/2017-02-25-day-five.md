## jam day

So, still working on Day Two, because I'm obsessed with natural dye... In the meantime, you might like to read the wrap up article that was written about this:

And, I don't think I'd call it 'couture', but we had an Open Day last week, so I took the opportunity to give Craig some professional development as well as have some fun. We were given T-shirts to wear that we were allowed to hack. So we did. We did some bleaching, some dyeing & some shiburi. 

We also swapped skills, and one of our lovely textile students developed a screenprint for us, lightbulbs and plugs, and we 3d printed the filament part of the lightbulb in luminescent filament with our names. I also did a couple of net files for the laser cutter to re/de-form the T-shirt and lengthen the sleeves. It was super-fun. Adding some EL wire was the icing on the cake.
