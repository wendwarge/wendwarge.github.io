I am all of the above and the Director of Fab Lab Wgtn, in New Zealand. This is what it says about me on our website: 

Wendy focuses on developing resilience, reciprocity and connections between diverse communities on a local and global level. With a digital and traditional craft-based design practice, Wendy designs and creates meaningful objects from salvaged materials and obsolete furniture.

I may, or may not, write more at another time...
