## lasercut seamless clothing and reconfigurable modular systems

After some inspiring talks by Anastasia, Cecilia & Zoe, we were invited to start experimenting with a laser cutter and fabrics to create samples for seamless clothing and reconfigurable modular systems.

Of particular interest to me were these initiatives:

[Another Shoe](http://anothershoe.squarespace.com/home)
[OpenFit](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/OpenFit)

As it was 4:00am in New Zealand, I decided to play around with some other things instead. I've also been working with laser cutters for more than a decade now - when I first started, my awesome friend [Genevieve Packer](http://www.genevievepacker.com/) and I spent a lot of time testing and developing settings for a range of textiles. We still use the basic theory for them and push...nudge...tweak them from there. Also, the laser cutter was fully utilised when I went into the Lab this afternoon. Though I did make up some samples for a workshop the other day, with my lovely collegues Craig, Jason & Stuart.

I downloaded [Make Human](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/), an open source modelling software for making 3D characters. I made myself. Well, as best I could... You'll note that I made modesty panels for the general viewer.

It's an interesting GUI, with tabs, and I clicked my way around them and pulled sliders for a while.

Then I found an old tape measure of my grandmother's and started inputting my measurements. It was super-interesting seeing 'myself' emerge onscreen. I had no idea I looked like that - I suppose the test will be when I print out my own mannequin and then start to create garments for it.

I also spent a bit of time running through a [grasshopper tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TFrz2eWyB0&t=324s) - it's been a long time since I played with that and I've never been proficient with it, so it was good to get those rusty skills going again. Especially when I missed a step and had to go way, way back to fix it. Always good to repeat the learning...

And just by the way, super glad to have installed [Time Snapper Classic](http://www.timesnapper.com/DownloadClassic.aspx) on my computer. It takes screenshots of your desktop however frequently you set it - I've set it for every five minutes - and essentially creates a log of your time on the 'puter so you don't have to remember to take screenshots. Otherwise, you wouldn't have had these images to look at!

I'll leave you with this thought from Slack:

And an image of the jars I put on my windowsill this afternoon.
