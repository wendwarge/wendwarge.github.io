## new materials & processes. grow your own clothes!

Cecilia spoke about the dangers of chemical dyes, to us and the environment - unmeasured impact and asked us: do we want to have that so close to our skins? And then talked to us about the projects she has been involved in with natural dyes and bacteria-based dyes. Then Anastasia talked about creating bio-plastics (sheet materials and 3d forms) and projects she's been involved in and showed us some samples.  

these initiatives were particularly interesting to me:
