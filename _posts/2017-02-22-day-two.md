## new materials & processes. grow your own clothes!

Cecilia spoke about the dangers of chemical dyes, to us and the environment - unmeasured impact and asked us: do we want to have that so close to our skins? Our skins breathe. And then talked to us about the projects she has been involved in with natural dyes and bacteria-based dyes. Then Anastasia talked about creating bio-plastics (sheet materials and 3d forms) and projects she's been involved in and showed us some samples.  

these initiatives were particularly interesting to me:

[Bio Plastics from coffee](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/bioplastics-made-coffee-orange-83241/)

It reminded me of the SCOBY 4th year project by [Kat Jensen](https://creative.massey.ac.nz/about/exposure-2015-end-of-year-exhibition/bdes-textiles/katerina-jensen) in 2015, which was inspired by 
[Suzanne Lee](http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/04/the-woman-who-grows-her-own-kombucha-clothes.html).

Both subjects made me really think about what it means to make something last. Permanent dyes, stable forms - we are focused toward these, but are they necessary? Permanent dyes have big impacts. Instead we can use natural dyes and watch them fade, re-dye things, let things naturally degrade. A meaningful built-in obsolescence. Allow our clothes to only last for a party.

### experiments - it's all about the preparation.

Remote participants were given a list of things we'd need for today's experiments. They were mysterious to me, but I did a little searching on my *preferred search engine* and remembered some things I'd learnt many years ago when I did a natural dye shiburi weekend workshop. I popped along to Fab Lab Wgtn and started gathering things that I thought would be useful, including some jars from our DIYbio Lab, which we've just re-created. It's now three times the size it used to be and our Mycologist in Residence is very pleased. We did our first oyster mushroom innoculation of 2017 last week, which is starting to be documented [here](http://fablabwgtn.github.io/DIY-biolab/post/Jenga-rafts.html). You can't see the mushroom house in the photo below, but it is there. One of our lovely MDes students laughed when he saw our new lab - the wall are made from a light tyvek, and he thought it looked like something that kids make when they're stuck inside on a rainy day, a blanket fort. That name might stick. Especially as we haven't quite got the airlock finished and it tends to billow if we exit and enter too quickly.

Anyway... you will have seen the photo I put in Day One of those jars filled with a range of interesting liquids & solids in the sun on my windowsill. I can't wait to see how the colours develop. 

I also gathered some toile 'rags' which our Fashion colleagues graciously give us - as Anastasia said: there's always fabric around. I also popped over to the Textiles area and had a chat with my lovely colleague [Hannah Clement](https://hannahclement.com/about/) who works with us on our soft sensors and our glitchknit [workshops](https://fablabwgtn.co.nz/events/). She found me some more fabric, and some loosely spun wool left over from a project. And was super-excited to hear about what I was doing. She gave me a couple of useful tips that I'm going to try out. And I've also been to the library!
