## new materials & processes. grow your own clothes!

![Day Two Begins](/images/2017-02-22-day-two/daytwobegins.png) 

Cecilia spoke about the dangers of chemical dyes, to us and the environment - unmeasured impact and asked us: do we want to have that so close to our skins? Our skins breathe. And then talked to us about the projects she has been involved in with natural dyes and bacteria-based dyes. Then Anastasia talked about creating bio-plastics (sheet materials and 3d forms) and projects she's been involved in and showed us some samples.  

these things were particularly interesting to me:

[Bio Plastics from coffee](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/bioplastics-made-coffee-orange-83241/)

It reminded me of the SCOBY 4th year project by [Kat Jensen](https://creative.massey.ac.nz/about/exposure-2015-end-of-year-exhibition/bdes-textiles/katerina-jensen) in 2015, which was inspired by 
[Suzanne Lee](http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/04/the-woman-who-grows-her-own-kombucha-clothes.html).

Both subjects made me really think about what it means to make something last. Permanent dyes, stable forms - we are focused toward these, but are they necessary? Permanent dyes have big impacts. Instead we can use natural dyes and watch them fade, re-dye things, let things naturally degrade. A meaningful built-in obsolescence. Allow our clothes to only last for a party.

### experiments - it's all about the preparation.

Remote participants were given a list of things we'd need for today's experiments. They were mysterious to me, but I did a little searching on my *preferred search engine* and remembered some things I'd learnt many years ago when I did a natural dye shiburi weekend workshop. I popped along to Fab Lab Wgtn and started gathering things that I thought would be useful, including some jars from our DIYbio Lab, which we've just re-created. It's now three times the size it used to be and our Mycologist in Residence is very pleased. We did our first oyster mushroom innoculation of 2017 last week, which is starting to be documented [here](http://fablabwgtn.github.io/DIY-biolab/post/Jenga-rafts.html). You can't see the mushroom house in the photo below, but it is there. One of our lovely MDes students laughed when he saw our new lab - the wall are made from a light tyvek, and he thought it looked like something that kids make when they're stuck inside on a rainy day, a blanket fort. That name might stick. Especially as we haven't quite got the airlock finished and it tends to billow if we exit and enter too quickly.

Anyway... you will have seen the photo I put in Day One of those jars filled with a range of interesting liquids & solids in the sun on my windowsill. I can't wait to see how the colours develop. 

I gathered some toile 'rags' which our Fashion colleagues graciously give us - as Anastasia said: there's always fabric around. I also popped over to the Textiles area and had a chat with my lovely colleague [Hannah Clement](https://hannahclement.com/about/) who works with us on our soft sensors and our glitchknit [workshops](https://fablabwgtn.co.nz/events/). She found me some more fabric, and some loosely spun wool left over from a project. And was super-excited to hear about what I was doing. She gave me a couple of useful tips that I'm going to try out. And I've also been to the library!

### hands-on: BioDyes - alternatives for the dyeing industry

This [Bio Shades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsD5VuH4Y7w&feature=youtu.be) video is great. But I think I will go to sleep now.

### experiments - then it's all about having enough information to be joyfully free to make mistakes

I was feeling a bit trepidatious, working  on my own and wondering whether I'd be doing it correctly. But then I remembered that I'm not a scientist and that making mistakes is the space where creativity can thrive. It helps that everything is non-toxic. There is plenty of technical information available, both from the Textile bootcamp, websites, books and other people. I'm not making groundbreaking discoveries - it's all been done before, I'm just trying to work out what it means to my practice. And hands-on leaning is the best way to do this.

Rolling up my metaphorical sleeves (it's summer so I'm not wearing any) I started with the walnut shells. They been soaking on my windowsill for about 20 hours. I poured them into an aluminium pan (yes I know, it's not the correct metal but it's the only one I have that I'm prepared to sacrifice to the dyeing process - anyway, isn't alum a fixer?), added water and started boiling. I simmered it for half an hour, topping up the water as it reduced. It's not the most delicious smell ever. But it's not as _maladorous_ as some things. I had to use that word - I read it today and thought: now that's a word that's seldom used. Anyway, I was hanging over the pan, thinking it was a bit smelly, and I thought, I could put cinnamon in to mask the smell. Well imagine my surprise, when I used my *preferred search engine* to check whether it would be OK, to find that cinnamon is used to lighten hair colour! I decided to leave it out.

Back to the dye pot. According to a number of instructions, you should break up the shells into smaller pieces. I suppose that's to increase the surface area in contact with the water, drawing out the colour more quickly. Hmmm - maybe I am an amateur scientist after all. I left some of them intact, because I had an experiment in mind for later... I had to sneak up on that last photo, on the right, there was steam everywhere.

And this is the material that I'm dyeing - natural twisted wool, calico and 2mm felted wool. The paper is my experiment - Stuart laser etched it the other day.

![Samples Walnut](/images/2017-02-22-day-two/samples-walnut.png)

And then I started on the onion skins - using a stainless steel pan this time.

The top samples are the walnut dye, the bottom samples are red & brown onion skin dye, the couple in the centre-left are walnut and onion. I don't think I scoured the wool well enough - when I was dyeing it in two of the batches, I could smell lanolin. Lanolin and onion is an interesting smell. 

Next: Iron & vinegar. I poured the vinegar solution (which has been soaking for two days now) into my sacrificial aluminium pan. I have used this combination to colour some of my furniture pieces, so I knew that it wouldn't change colour in the jar. I was still surprised when I turned my back and the liquid in the pan turned black in seconds. Even though people warn that iron impacts on the integrity of wool, I thought I'd give it a try, and I like the colour that came out. I also applied iron filings directly to wet calico and liked the result.
