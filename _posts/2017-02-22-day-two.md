## new materials & processes. grow your own clothes!

Cecilia spoke about the dangers of chemical dyes, to us and the environment - unmeasured impact and asked us: do we want to have that so close to our skins? Our skins breathe. And then talked to us about the projects she has been involved in with natural dyes and bacteria-based dyes. Then Anastasia talked about creating bio-plastics (sheet materials and 3d forms) and projects she's been involved in and showed us some samples.  

these initiatives were particularly interesting to me:

[Bio Plastic 'skin'](http://materiability.com/skin-2/)

[Bio Plastics from coffee](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/bioplastics-made-coffee-orange-83241/)

It reminded me of the SCOBY 4th year project by [Kat Jensen](https://creative.massey.ac.nz/about/exposure-2015-end-of-year-exhibition/bdes-textiles/katerina-jensen) in 2015, which was inspired by 
[Suzanne Lee](http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/04/the-woman-who-grows-her-own-kombucha-clothes.html).

Both subjects made me really think about what it means to make something last. Permanent dyes, stable forms - we are focused toward these, but are they necessary? Permanent dyes have big impacts. Instead we can use natural dyes and watch them fade, re-dye things, let things naturally degrade. A meaningful built-in obsolescence. Allow our clothes to only last for a party.

### experiment

Remote participants were given a list of things we'd need for today's experiments. They were mysterious to me, but I did a little searching on my *preferred search engine* and remembered some things I'd learnt many years ago when I did a natural dye shiburi weekend workshop. I popped along to Fab Lab Wgtn and started gathering things that I thought would be useful, including some jars from our DIYbio lab - you will have seen the photo I put in Day One of those jars filled with a range of interesting liquids & solids in the sun on my windowsill. I can't wait to see how the colours develop. 

I also gathered some toile 'rags' - as Anastasia said: there's always fabric around. i also popped over to the Textiles area and had a chat with my lovely colleague [hannah Clement](https://hannahclement.com/about/) who works with us on our soft sensors and our glitchknit [workshops](https://fablabwgtn.co.nz/events/). She found me some more fabric, and some loosely spun wool left over from a project. And was super-excited to hear about what I was doing.
