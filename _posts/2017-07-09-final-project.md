### inspiration

I love the pleating work by the Lognon Atelier, [Issey Miyake's](http://isseymiyake.com/en/) folded fabrics and [Polly Verity's](https://polyscene.com/) paper sculptures. Texture and pattern have always played a big part in my work.

### intention

To explore folding and weaving techniques until I understand how I can modify & apply those forms to create a component-based parametric upholstered surface. Using 3D forms that lock together to create pockets of air as cushioning instead of the usual upholstery foam.
