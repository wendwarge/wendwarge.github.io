## computational couture

![Day Two Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.png) 

I'm sure you can guess from the name above, today was all about computing. From scanning and 3D printing to virtual wardrobes. [Aldo Solazzo](http://noumena.io/about/) was super-excited to give us a tutorial on using parametric software to generate 2D & 3D forms. We used Rhino and the grasshopper plug-in, and I now have a few others that he recommended as well. We also attended the Fab Academy class, which was about 3D scanning and printing.  

these initiatives were particularly interesting to me:

### experiments - it's all about the preparation.
