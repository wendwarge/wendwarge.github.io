## computational couture

![Day Two Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.png) 

I'm sure you can guess from the name above, today was all about computing. From scanning and 3D printing to virtual wardrobes. [Aldo Solazzo](http://noumena.io/about/) gave us an entertaining and informative tutorial on using parametric software to generate 2D & 3D forms. We used Rhino and the [grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) plug-in, and I now have a few others that he recommended as well. We also attended this week's Fab Academy class, which was about 3D scanning and printing.  

These things were particularly interesting to me:

I won't spend a lot of time talking about working with grasshopper, but I will say that it's awesome. There are some great online tutorials - on the grasshopper website (link above), on youtube and on individual people's websites. When I first started learning, I found the basic ones on the grasshopper site really useful because they start from scratch. There are a couple of things that I find a bit annoying, but it's more to do with old habits than the software. I'm using the Windows side of a triple-boot Mac and the delete key works in Rhino but not grasshopper, the F function keys don't work and the hot-key habits I have from adobe do strange things sometimes in Rhino/grasshopper.

At some point I might do a tutorial for the project I plan to make, but that will be a while away. There will be no hot key tips.



### experiments - it's all about the preparation.
