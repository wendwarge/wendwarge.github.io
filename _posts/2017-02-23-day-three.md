## computational couture

![Day Two Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.png) 

I'm sure you can guess from the name above, today was all about computing. From scanning and 3D printing to virtual wardrobes. [Aldo Solazzo](http://noumena.io/about/) gave us an entertaining and informative tutorial on using parametric software to generate 2D & 3D forms. We used Rhino and the [grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) plug-in, and I now have a few others that he recommended as well. We also attended this week's Fab Academy class, which was about 3D scanning and printing.  

These things were particularly interesting to me:

I won't spend a lot of time talking about working with grasshopper, but I will say that it's awesome. There are some great online tutorials - on the grasshopper website (link above), on youtube and on individual people's websites. When I first started learning, I found the basic ones on the grasshopper site really useful because they start from scratch. There are a couple of things that I find a bit annoying, but it's more to do with old habits than the software. I'm using the Windows side of a triple-boot Mac and the delete key works in Rhino but not grasshopper, the F function keys don't work and the hot-key habits I have from adobe do strange things sometimes in Rhino/grasshopper.

At some point I might do a tutorial for the project I plan to make, but that will be a while away. There will be no hot key tips.

While experimenting with grasshopper today, I listened to [Amanda Palmer's](https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking) Ted talk, The Art of Asking, which a colleague of mine sent me. Lovely. I recommend it. 

You might remember that I also created a copper solution for dying. It's been sitting on the windowsill for quite some time now. It wasn't possible to get ammonia for this, so I just used white vinegar instead. You can see that it's a very pale blue which is not what I hoped for, based on what I'd seen in my research. I imagine that it hasn't gone darker because I used vinegar and maybe because there's very little surface area as the copper is in one lump. I will have a chat with the Textile designers at work about it next week - they're all up in the natural dyes.

### experiments - it's all about the spaces.

Syntax. It's important. So, not only can it be a problem when you're generating markdown, programming electronics etc., it can make your components fail in grasshopper as well. *Of course.* I was trying out a colour gradient and I got an error message which was really annoying. Couldn't see anything wrong... that's because there was a space.
