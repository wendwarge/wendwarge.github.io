## computational couture

![Day Three Begins](/images/2017-02-23-day-three/grasshopper.png) 

I'm sure you can guess from the name above, today was all about computing. From scanning and 3D printing to virtual wardrobes. [Aldo Solazzo](http://noumena.io/about/) gave us an entertaining and informative tutorial on using parametric software to generate 2D & 3D forms. We used Rhino and the [grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) plug-in, and I now have a few others that he recommended as well. We also attended this week's Fab Academy class, which was about 3D scanning and printing.  

These things were particularly interesting to me:

I won't spend a lot of time talking about working with grasshopper, but I will say that it's awesome. There are some great online tutorials - on the grasshopper website (link above), on youtube and on individual people's websites. When I first started learning, I found the basic ones on the grasshopper site really useful because they start from scratch. There are a couple of things that I find a bit annoying, but it's more to do with old habits than the software. I'm using the Windows side of a triple-boot Mac and the delete key works in Rhino but not grasshopper, the F function keys don't work and the hot-key habits I have from adobe do strange things sometimes in Rhino/grasshopper.

At some point I might do a tutorial for the project I plan to make, but that will be a while away. There will be no hot key tips.

While experimenting with grasshopper today, I listened to [Amanda Palmer's](https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking) Ted talk, The Art of Asking, which a colleague sent me. Lovely. I recommend it. 

You might remember that I also created a copper solution for dying. It's been sitting on the windowsill for quite some time now. It wasn't possible to get ammonia for this, so I just used white vinegar instead. You can see that it's a very pale blue which is not what I hoped for, based on what I'd seen in my research. I imagine that it hasn't gone darker because I used vinegar and maybe because there's very little surface area as the copper is in one lump. I will have a chat with the Textile designers at work about it next week - they're all up in the natural dyes. Cecilia suggested that I expose the copper to the air so that it oxidises more quickly, so I've done that. GIF below shows after 24 hours, after 6 days, then two weeks.

It's reminding me of the chemistry set we had when we were kids. We made a saturated solution with copper which crystalised, then harvested and suspended a crystal in a new solution from cotton and watched it grow over a period of weeks.

### experiments - it's all about the spaces.

Syntax. It's important. So, not only can it be a problem when you're generating markdown, programming electronics etc., it can make your components fail in grasshopper as well. *Of course.* I was trying out a colour gradient and I got an error message which was really annoying. Couldn't see anything wrong... that's because there was a space. Thankfully, Aldo warned us about that in 'panels' and I eventually remembered to check.  

It's also all about system design, you can't just design as you go. 

I decided to continue with my MakeHuman me, so exported it as an stl, and opened it up in Rhino.

I drew some lines where I wanted to cut the mesh, used ExtrudeCrv to make it a plane intersecting with my mesh and then used MeshSplit to cut it. I could probably have cut the arms more closely, but I started to feel a bit wierd about cutting myself up. I messed around for a while trying to cap the holes, but thought I'd just open it up in 123D Make and see what happened.

It imported just fine. Except that it defaulted to inches and it was SUPER ANNOYING to try to get it to the right size. And the software kept freezing and failing. I forgot how much you have to pause with this one.
